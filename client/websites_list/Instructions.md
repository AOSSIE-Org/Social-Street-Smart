(1) Using build_json script you can build the json file that chrome extension use for the objectionable website alert feature.

(2) Add a website, its domain and some information related to it (anything you feel the user should know about the site when he/she visits it, stuff like political alignment, ownership, clickait etc..)

(3) Adhere to the format in the csv, after making your changes run the build_json.py script and a new json file with your additions would be generated in 'common' directory.
